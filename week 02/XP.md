# XP ( Extreme Programming Framework )
## Definition
Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology that emphasizes iterative and incremental development, frequent releases, customer involvement, and a focus on quality code. XP is one of the agile methodologies and is designed to help teams quickly respond to changing requirements.
XP is a set of engineering practices. Developers have to go beyond their capabilities while performing these practices. That’s where the “extreme” in the framework’s title comes from. To get a better understanding of these practices, we’ll start with describing XP’s lifecycle and the roles engaged in the process. 
## The process and roles of extreme programming
The XP framework normally involves 5 phases or stages of the development process that iterate continuously:
### Planning 
the first stage, is when the customer meets the development team and presents the requirements in the form of user stories to describe the desired result. The team then estimates the stories and creates a release plan broken down into iterations needed to cover the required functionality part after part. If one or more of the stories can’t be estimated, so-called spikes can be introduced which means that further research is needed
### Designing 
is actually a part of the planning process, but can be set apart to emphasize its importance. It’s related to one of the main XP values that we’ll discuss below — simplicity. A good design brings logic and structure to the system and allows to avoid unnecessary complexities and redundancies.
### Coding 
is the phase during which the actual code is created by implementing specific XP practices such as coding standards, pair programming, continuous integration, and collective code ownership (the entire list is described below).
### Testing 
is the core of extreme programming. It is the regular activity that involves both unit tests (automated testing to determine if the developed feature works properly) and acceptance tests (customer testing to verify that the overall system is created according to the initial requirements).
### Listening 
is all about constant communication and feedback. The customers and project managers are involved to describe the business logic and value that is expected.

Such a development process entails the cooperation between several participants, each having his or her own tasks and responsibilities. Extreme programming puts people in the center of the system, emphasizing the value and importance of such social skills as communication, cooperation, responsiveness, and feedback. So, these roles are commonly associated with XP:
### Customers 
are expected to be heavily engaged in the development process by creating user stories, providing continuous feedback, and making all the necessary business decisions related to the project.
### Programmers or developers
are the team members that actually create the product. They are responsible for implementing user stories and conducting user tests (sometimes a separate Tester role is set apart). Since XP is usually associated with cross-functional teams, the skill set of such members can be different.
### Trackers or managers
link customers and developers. It’s not a required role and can be performed by one of the developers. These people organize the meetups, regulate discussions, and keep track of important progress KPIs.
### Coaches
can be included in the teams as mentors to help with understanding the XP practices. It’s usually an outside assistant or external consultant who is not involved in the development process, but has used XP before and so can help avoid mistakes.
## Values and principles of extreme programming
In the late 90s, Ken Beck summarized a set of certain values and principles that describe extreme programming and lead to more effective cooperation within the team and, ultimately, higher product quality.
