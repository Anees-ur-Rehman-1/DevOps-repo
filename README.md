## Introduction
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives. The main goal of DevOps is to foster collaboration between development and operations teams, automate infrastructure, and continuously deliver high-quality software.
