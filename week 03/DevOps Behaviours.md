# Required DevOps Behaviors

DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration, integration, and automation between development and operations teams to improve the software delivery process. DevOps behaviors refer to the set of principles and practices that are necessary for successfully implementing DevOps. In this context, there are several key DevOps behaviors that are important to understand:

## Collaboration:
DevOps requires close collaboration between developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders to ensure smooth and efficient software delivery. Some examples of collaboration in DevOps include:

###  1.Cross-functional teams:
Development, operations, and other teams work together to achieve common goals.

###  2. Joint planning and decision-making: 
Teams collaborate to plan and make decisions about the software development process, such as which tools to use and how to optimize workflows.

###  3. Knowledge sharing: 
Teams share information and best practices to improve the overall performance of the software delivery process.

## Automation: 
DevOps relies heavily on automation to streamline the software delivery process and minimize the risk of errors. Some examples of automation in DevOps include:

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines:
Automated processes that allow developers to build, test, and deploy code changes to production quickly and reliably.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): The use of automated scripts to provision and configure infrastructure, making it easier to manage and maintain infrastructure at scale.

## Automated testing: 
The use of tools to automate testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): 
CI/CD is a set of practices that involve integrating code changes into a shared repository and automating the deployment of those changes to production. Some examples of CI/CD in DevOps include:

## Automated testing and deployment:
Developers can use automated tools to test and deploy code changes, reducing the risk of errors and improving the speed of the software delivery process.

## Version control:
Developers use version control systems to manage code changes, making it easier to collaborate and manage code changes over time.

## Continuous monitoring and feedback:
Teams can use automated monitoring tools to track the performance of software in production, providing continuous feedback that can help them improve the software delivery process.

## Monitoring and Feedback:
DevOps relies on monitoring and feedback to ensure that software is performing as expected and to identify opportunities for improvement. Some examples of monitoring and feedback in DevOps include:

## Performance monitoring: 
Teams can use tools to monitor the performance of applications and infrastructure, identifying issues before they impact users.

## User feedback:
Teams can gather feedback from users to identify opportunities to improve the user experience.

## Continuous improvement:
Teams use feedback and data to continually improve the software delivery process, optimizing workflows and increasing efficiency over time.

## Continuous Learning:
Continuous Learning is a key DevOps behavior that involves continually seeking out new knowledge, skills, and best practices. This can include attending conferences, participating in online forums, and engaging in peer-to-peer learning. Continuous Learning helps teams to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies and to continually improve their processes and workflows.



Examples of DevOps behaviors include:
•	Multidisciplinary: “Team members actively pick up each other’s tasks when they see a team member is too busy or unavailable”
•	Transparency: “The team publishes real-time progress reports on the floor monitors”
•	Ownership: “The Product Owner drives the demos and adequately informs all his/her stakeholders regarding progress and deliverables”
•	Prioritization: “The PO and TMs jointly discuss at least once per sprint the prioritization of the work on both functional and non-functional work items”
•	Improve: “Every severe incident is followed by a blameless postmortem, where everyone involved shares ideas & opportunities for improvement”
•	Fail safe: “All managers openly reward the identification, prevention ánd resolution of errors.”
