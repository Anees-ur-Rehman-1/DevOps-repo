# Difference between DevOps and DevSecOps
***DevOps*** combines “development” and “operations” to describe a collaborative or shared-responsibility model for building applications. It views the work performed by the software development and IT operations teams as a single process.

The DevOps philosophy promotes closer collaboration and constant communication between the different teams within an organization. In its narrowest sense, DevOps refers to iterative processes involved in application development, automation, and the deployment and maintenance of programmable infrastructure.

DevOps also refers to a cultural change, such as building trust between system admins and developers and aligning technology projects with business objectives. DevOps can transform an organization’s software delivery pipeline, job functions, tools, and practices.

***DevSecOps*** is a software development management approach introducing security to the DevOps equation. It creates an automated Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline by combining development, operations, security, and infrastructure as code (IaaS).

The primary purpose of DevSecOps is to automate, manage, and enforce security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It requires monitoring and applying security at each pipeline stage, including planning, building, testing, delivery, deployment, operations, and monitoring. Implementing security practices at all stages of the development process allows organizations to achieve Continuous Integration (CI), lower compliance-related costs, and accelerate software delivery.

DevSecOps requires all teams and employees to take responsibility for security from the start and perform their tasks without compromising security.

## Importance of DevSecOps: 
Organizations today rely on complex on-premises, cloud-based, and hybrid environments to support IT operations. Adding to this complexity is the constant creation of new applications and updates. Many organizations use cloud containers and microservices to develop applications in-house.

Whenever an employee creates or modifies a component or asset connected to the Internet, a misconfiguration or new vulnerability could expose the application to attack. Additional complexities that increase the risk include accelerating development, automating parts of the application delivery process, and splitting applications into microservices. Developers often make small mistakes, leaving assets vulnerable to cyberattacks.

Software engineering teams also use tools to automate tasks like configuring and maintaining containers, servers, image registries, and code repositories. All these components can introduce security vulnerabilities.
While standard DevOps workflows deliver tangible business value, they are also a significant source of risk. Therefore, the security focus of DevSecOps is crucial. Securing the software development environment should be an integral part of the development process, not an afterthought.

## DevOps and  DevSecOps: 
DevOps is a broad concept encompassing various organizational strategies. The core of DevOps is the shared responsibility between traditionally separate teams. It originated as a general paradigm with common practices but has now become a well-defined workplace culture and development process.

Organizations that adopt a shared responsibility approach to development and operations can produce faster iterations and release more successful applications. DevSecOps extends this philosophy by incorporating security goals and practices into the overall business objectives.

DevSecOps is a natural evolution of DevOps, not a separate concept. Successful DevOps teams, already used to DevOps practices, can approach DevSecOps as the logical next step in the DevOps adoption process.

While the initial objective of DevOps was to create business value in a seamless development workflow (from build to production environments), many standard DevOps tools and practices neglect security, focussing on fast releases. The result was often security bottlenecks, where traditional security pipelines were too slow for the faster DevOps process.

Many organizations left security to post-production or even an external team, resulting in slow security feedback loops.
