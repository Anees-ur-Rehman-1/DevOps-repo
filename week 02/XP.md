# XP ( Extreme Programming Framework )
## Definition
Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology that emphasizes iterative and incremental development, frequent releases, customer involvement, and a focus on quality code. XP is one of the agile methodologies and is designed to help teams quickly respond to changing requirements.
XP is a set of engineering practices. Developers have to go beyond their capabilities while performing these practices. That’s where the “extreme” in the framework’s title comes from. To get a better understanding of these practices, we’ll start with describing XP’s lifecycle and the roles engaged in the process. 
## The process and roles of extreme programming
The XP framework normally involves 5 phases or stages of the development process that iterate continuously:
### Planning 
the first stage, is when the customer meets the development team and presents the requirements in the form of user stories to describe the desired result. The team then estimates the stories and creates a release plan broken down into iterations needed to cover the required functionality part after part. If one or more of the stories can’t be estimated, so-called spikes can be introduced which means that further research is needed
### Designing 
is actually a part of the planning process, but can be set apart to emphasize its importance. It’s related to one of the main XP values that we’ll discuss below — simplicity. A good design brings logic and structure to the system and allows to avoid unnecessary complexities and redundancies.
### Coding 
is the phase during which the actual code is created by implementing specific XP practices such as coding standards, pair programming, continuous integration, and collective code ownership (the entire list is described below).
### Testing 
is the core of extreme programming. It is the regular activity that involves both unit tests (automated testing to determine if the developed feature works properly) and acceptance tests (customer testing to verify that the overall system is created according to the initial requirements).
### Listening 
is all about constant communication and feedback. The customers and project managers are involved to describe the business logic and value that is expected.
