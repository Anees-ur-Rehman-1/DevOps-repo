# Difference between BDD vs TDD in Software Engineering

|S.NO.|Behavior Driven Development|Test Driven Development|
|:----|:--------------------------|:----------------------|
|01.|Behavior Driven Development is a development technique which focuses more on a software application’s behavior|Test Driven Development is a development technique which focuses more on the implementation of a feature of a software application/product.|
|02.|In BDD the participants are Developers, Customer, QAs.|In TDD the participants are developers.|
|03.|Mainly it creates an executable specification that fails because the respective feature doesn’t exist, then writing the simplest code that can make the specification pass and as a result we get the required behavior implemented in the system.|Mainly it refers to write a test case that fails because the specified functionality doesn’t exist and after that update the code that can make the test case pass and as a result we get the feature implemented in the system.|
|04.|Its main focus is on system requirements.|Its main focus is on unit test.|
|05.|In BDD the starting point is a scenario.|In TDD the starting point is a test case.|
|06.|It is a team methodology.|It is a development practice.|
|07.|Here language used to write behavior/scenarios is simple English language.|Here language is used is similar to the one used for feature development like programming |
