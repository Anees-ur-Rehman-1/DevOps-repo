As a DevOps practitioner, having a good understanding of basic Linux commands is essential. Here are some commonly used Linux commands that can be helpful in your day-to-day DevOps tasks:

Example: cd /path/to/directory to navigate to a specific directory.
pwd: Print the current working directory.

mkdir: Create a new directory.

Example: mkdir new_directory to create a directory named "new_directory".
rm: Remove files and directories.

Example: rm file.txt to delete a file named "file.txt".
Example: rm -r directory to remove a directory and its contents recursively.
cp: Copy files and directories.

Example: cp file.txt /path/to/destination to copy "file.txt" to a specified destination.
mv: Move or rename files and directories.

Example: mv file.txt /path/to/destination to move "file.txt" to a specified destination.
Example: mv old_name new_name to rename a file or directory.
cat: Display the contents of a file.

Example: cat file.txt to view the contents of "file.txt".
grep: Search for a specific pattern in files.

Example: grep "pattern" file.txt to search for "pattern" in "file.txt".
chmod: Change file permissions.

Example: chmod 644 file.txt to set read and write permissions for the owner and read-only permissions for others.
chown: Change file ownership.

Example: chown user:group file.txt to change the owner and group of "file.txt".
sudo: Execute a command with superuser privileges.

Example: sudo apt-get update to update package lists using administrative privileges.

tar: Create or extract compressed archives.

Example: tar -czvf archive.tar.gz directory to create a compressed archive of a directory.
Example: tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz to extract files from a compressed archive.
These are just a few examples of Linux commands commonly used in DevOps. The Linux command-line interface offers a vast array of commands and options, so it's recommended to explore the manual pages (man command) for more detailed information about each command's usage and options.
