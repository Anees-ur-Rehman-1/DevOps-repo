# Brief history of DevOps
________________________________________
 If DevOps had a birth certificate, the father’s name would be penned in as Patrick Debois. Patrick was interested in learning IT from every perspective, and in 2007, he began working on a large data center migration where he was in charge of testing. During this project, he realized that the frustrations experienced in projects such as these are from the constant switching back and forth between the development side of the problem and the silo of operations on the other side of the fence. He recognized that a lot of time and effort was wasted navigating the project between these two worlds, but the divide between them seemed too wide to bridge.

 Later, in 2008 during an Agile conference held in Toronto, Canada, a man by the name of Andrew Shafer tried to put together a meetup session entitled “Agile Infrastructure.” When Patrick showed up for the session, he was the only one there. Andrew had received so much negative feedback from his posting that not even he showed up to his own session. However, Patrick was so excited to learn of a like-minded person that he hunted him down at the conference and had that talk in the hallway. They formed a discussion group for other people to post their ideas for how to solve this divide between development and operations later that year.

Initially, the interest was pretty tame and not a whole lot came of it. In June of 2009, John Allspaw and Paul Hammond gave a talk entitled “10+ Deploys a Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr.” Our friend Patrick happened to watch the streaming video of that presentation at his home in Belgium, and it instantly resonated with him. He realized this was exactly the solution for which he had been looking. Emboldened by this presentation, he put out a call to have a gathering of developers and system administrators to get together and discuss the best ways to start bridging the gap between the two disparate fields.

He named the event DevOpsDays, occurring in the last days of October in 2009. This event garnered a fair amount of attention from experts in both fields and sparked lively debates over Twitter where the hashtag was soon shortened to simply DevOps. It wasn’t long before some of the smaller tech enterprises were attempting to put together DevOps practices as well as tools built to aid these newly forming teams. DevOps had managed to achieve a grassroots following that was starting to put their ideas to use.

Finally, in March of 2011, Cameron Haight of Gartner presented his predictions for the trajectory of DevOps over the next few years. His positive outlook on its impact on the industry lead to more attention for the DevOps movement, and it wasn’t long before enterprises of all sizes were beginning to adopt these new practices. DevOps had officially caught on as the next big thing since Agile for the IT industry.
