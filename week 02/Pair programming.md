# What is pair programming? 
Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together on the same computer to complete a coding task. One programmer, known as the "driver," actively writes the code while the other, known as the "navigator," reviews the code as it is being written and provides feedback and suggestions.
The driver is responsible for implementing the coding task while the navigator takes a broader view of the work and ensures that the code is correct, efficient, and meets the project's requirements. Both participants actively communicate and collaborate during the process, sharing their ideas and discussing solutions to problems.
Pair programming is often used in Agile development methodologies and is believed to improve code quality, reduce errors, and enhance team collaboration and knowledge sharing. It is also a helpful way for less experienced programmers to learn from more experienced ones, and for team members to stay up to date with best practices and new techniques.
## Benefits of pair programming
### Fewer bugs and mistakes
When software developers work alone, they can fall victim to many problems. Tunnel vision or stubbornness in using a specific method for solving a problem – these are just the tip of the iceberg. They might get stuck while trying to fix a bug based on an incorrect assumption. They might have gaps in knowledge or simply make some typos. 
In pair programming, two developers are forced to work as a team. And another pair of eyes looking at the code automatically adds more quality control to the process of its writing. Both developers use their shared knowledge and experience to solve problems faster, even immediately after they arise. According to a study from the University of Utah, code developed during pair programming comes with 15% fewer defects. 
Having a partner with you while you code also allows practicing techniques like rubber duck debugging. This method of debugging assumes that you explain your code in the simplest terms, line by line – as if explaining it to a cute rubber duck that just isn't very proficient in coding. This allows the partner to easily identify your biases or misconceptions and help you get back on track quicker. 
### Greater resilience
Every software development team should consider this factor in their projects:
If a person gets hit by a bus (or needs to suddenly depart from the project for another – perhaps more realistic – reason) what will happen to the project? Is there any valuable technical knowledge that would be lost forever with that person gone just because they're the only person on the team who has it? 
Pair programming eliminates this concern because it means that at least two people will become very familiar with some part of the codebase. The information will never live with only one person, which helps to prevent unexpected project disruptions or delays due to staff turnover. 
### Improved code quality
When sharing best practices with each other, developers get to increase the overall quality of the code. Moreover, when a developer needs to be accountable to their partner, they're less likely to take any shortcuts or use hacks. 
Pair programming is a practice that encourages team members to build robust solutions that won't create any unexpected bugs later on and minimize technical debt. 
### Faster training
In pair programming, the partners are usually two mid-level/senior developers, or one seasoned coder and one junior developer. In the latter scenario, pair programming makes for an excellent opportunity for junior or new team members who can pick up a wealth of insights from their more experienced colleagues. As you can imagine, this accelerates the onboarding process as well. 
### Better team morale
Pair programming is an opportunity to talk to someone else on the project. Your partner can empathize with you and help you solve problems, so you're never stuck in your brain the entire day. That's why pair programming makes the entire team more productive and happier. 
According to one survey, 96% of developers who practice pair programming at work say that they enjoy their job more than when programming alone.
### Better knowledge sharing
Paired programming offers a great opportunity for team members to share and exchange their knowledge and experience at coding as they get to learn from their colleagues. It allows developers to receive immediate, face-to-face, and practical teaching. This is far more efficient than online tutorials and faster than searching the Internet for information. 

More senior programmers may also teach developers some of those highly valuable but non-written best practices and methodologies. Pair programming serves as a fantastic method for programmers to form mentorship ties.
Moreover, pair programming boosts the interpersonal skills of your employees. Working together on a single project teaches your team the importance of communication and collaboration
