# Daily Workflow in Agile Development
Agile development involves a daily workflow that is designed to keep the development team on track and ensure that they are making progress towards their goals. The daily workflow consists of several key meetings and activities that are outlined below:

## 1. Daily Standup: 
The daily standup is a short meeting where the development team meets to discuss their progress, identify any obstacles, and plan their work for the day. The meeting should be kept short and focused on the following three questions:

* What did you accomplish yesterday?
* What are you planning to work on today?
* Are there any obstacles that are preventing you from making progress?

The goal of the daily standup is to keep the team aligned and ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals.

## 2. Sprint Retrospective: 
The sprint retrospective is a meeting that takes place at the end of each sprint. The purpose of the meeting is to review the work that was completed during the sprint, identify areas for improvement, and make plans for the next sprint. The meeting should be structured around the following questions:

1. What went well during the sprint?
2. What didn't go well during the sprint?
3. What can we do to improve in the next sprint?

The goal of the sprint retrospective is to continuously improve the development process and ensure that the team is working efficiently.

## 3. Sprint Review:
 The sprint review is a meeting where the development team meets with the product owner and other stakeholders to review the work that was completed during the sprint. The goal of the meeting is to demonstrate the work that was completed and receive feedback from stakeholders. The meeting should include the following elements:

1. A demonstration of the completed work
2. A review of the sprint goals
3. Feedback from stakeholders

The goal of the sprint review is to ensure that the development team is meeting the needs of the stakeholders and that the work is aligned with the product vision.

## 4. Potential attendees of these meetings include:

. Development team members
. Product owner
. Scrum master
. Stakeholders

Each meeting should have a clear agenda and be kept short and focused. The meetings should also be held at a consistent time and place to ensure that everyone is able to attend.
