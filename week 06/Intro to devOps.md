# What is DevOps?
The word DevOps is a combination of two words Development and Operations. Before getting into what DevOps is, let us get an idea about the two teams involved in software development. The development team is responsible for developing, designing, and building the application. The operation team deals with the deployment and testing of the application. If there are problems with the application, the operation team also provides feedback to the development team. Now let us get to the history of DevOps.

# History of Devops
Let us see some important events of DevOps :

**2007-2008:** The DevOps idea was started

**2009:** In the initial stage the first conference was ” Deploys a day: Dev and Ops cooperation of flicker.”  Another conference called “DevOps Days in Ghent, Belgium” also happened.

**2010**:DevOps days conference happened in the United States at mount view, calif.

**2012:** Allana browns at puppet creates a state of DevOps report


**2014:** Publishing the annual “State of DevOps report”

**2017:** Forrester Research calls 2017 “The Year of DevOps”

**2018:** 30 DevOps day conferences were scheduled across the united states.

# Why did we need DevOps?
As we know about the problems faced in traditional models like in the waterfall model, there is a problem of a one-way stream of work, due to which if there is any mistake, the whole process repeats, and there is no interaction with customers. Now, this is solved in agile by splitting the whole development plan into several iterations for better production efficiency.  The agile model also includes customer interaction with the company to rectify mistakes. But there is another problem faced in Agile too.


Here, the problem arises when the development team continuously changes the code for better performance and sends the code to the operations team for testing. But there may be a delay in the operations team feedback in situations like if the developers sent code for review at night but due to the unavailability of the operations team, there will be a delay in the project feedback.

So, DevOps is the solution to this problem. DevOps is a practice or a methodology in which the development and operations teams work together by including automation at the initial stages. So they can work on rapidly changing systems, fix bugs, and help to deliver a good quality of software in time.




# Waterfall Model 
Let’s consider traditionally developing software using a Waterfall Model in this Devops Tutorial.
