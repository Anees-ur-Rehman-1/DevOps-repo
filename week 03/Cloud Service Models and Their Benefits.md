# Cloud Service Models and Their Benefits.
Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing resources and services over the internet. There are three main cloud service models - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) - that organizations can use to meet their computing needs. Each model has its own benefits and advantages.

## Infrastructure as a Service Definition
Iaas is also known as Hardware as a Service (HaaS). It is one of the layers of the cloud computing platform. It allows customers to outsource their IT infrastructures such as servers, networking, processing, storage, virtual machines, and other resources. Customers access these resources on the Internet using a pay-as-per use model.

In traditional hosting services, IT infrastructure was rented out for a specific period of time, with pre-determined hardware configuration. The client paid for the configuration and time, regardless of the actual use. With the help of the IaaS cloud computing platform layer, clients can dynamically scale the configuration to meet changing requirements and are billed only for the services actually used.

IaaS cloud computing platform layer eliminates the need for every organization to maintain the IT infrastructure.

IaaS is offered in three models: public, private, and hybrid cloud. The private cloud implies that the infrastructure resides at the customer-premise. In the case of public cloud, it is located at the cloud computing platform vendor's data center, and the hybrid cloud is a combination of the two in which the customer selects the best of both public cloud or private cloud.

IaaS provider provides the following services -
1.	Compute: Computing as a Service includes virtual central processing units and virtual main memory for the Vms that is provisioned to the end- users.

2.	Storage: IaaS provider provides back-end storage for storing files.

3.	Network: Network as a Service (NaaS) provides networking components such as routers, switches, and bridges for the Vms.

4.	Load balancers: It provides load balancing capability at the infrastructure layer.

Advantages of IaaS cloud computing layer
There are the following advantages of IaaS computing layer -
1. Shared infrastructure
IaaS allows multiple users to share the same physical infrastructure.
2. Web access to the resources
Iaas allows IT users to access resources over the internet.
3. Pay-as-per-use model
IaaS providers provide services based on the pay-as-per-use basis. The users are required to pay for what they have used.
4. Focus on the core business
IaaS providers focus on the organization's core business rather than on IT infrastructure.
5. On-demand scalability
On-demand scalability is one of the biggest advantages of IaaS. Using IaaS, users do not worry about to upgrade software and troubleshoot the issues related to hardware components.
Disadvantages of IaaS cloud computing layer
1. Security
Security is one of the biggest issues in IaaS. Most of the IaaS providers are not able to provide 100% security.
2. Maintenance & Upgrade
Although IaaS service providers maintain the software, but they do not upgrade the software for some organizations.
3. Interoperability issues
It is difficult to migrate VM from one IaaS provider to the other, so the customers might face problem related to vendor lock-in.
Some important point about IaaS cloud computing layer
IaaS cloud computing platform cannot replace the traditional hosting method, but it provides more than that, and each resource which are used are predictable as per the usage.
IaaS cloud computing platform may not eliminate the need for an in-house IT department. It will be needed to monitor or control the IaaS setup. IT salary expenditure might not reduce significantly, but other IT expenses can be reduced.
Breakdowns at the IaaS cloud computing platform vendor's can bring your business to the halt stage. Assess the IaaS cloud computing platform vendor's stability and finances. Make sure that SLAs (i.e., Service Level Agreement) provide backups for data, hardware, network, and application failures. Image portability and third-party support is a plus point.
The IaaS cloud computing platform vendor can get access to your sensitive data. So, engage with credible companies or organizations. Study their security policies and precautions.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS):
Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides a runtime environment. It allows programmers to easily create, test, run, and deploy web applications. You can purchase these applications from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-per use basis and access them using the Internet connection. In PaaS, back end scalability is managed by the cloud service provider, so end- users do not need to worry about managing the infrastructure. 
PaaS includes infrastructure (servers, storage, and networking) and platform (middleware, development tools, database management systems, business intelligence, and more) to support the web application life cycle.
Example: Google App Engine, Force.com, Joyent, Azure.
PaaS providers provide the Programming languages, Application frameworks, Databases, and Other tools:




1. Programming languages
PaaS providers provide various programming languages for the developers to develop the applications. Some popular programming languages provided by PaaS providers are Java, PHP, Ruby, Perl, and Go.
2. Application frameworks
PaaS providers provide application frameworks to easily understand the application development. Some popular application frameworks provided by PaaS providers are Node.js, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Spring, Play, Rack, and Zend.
3. Databases
PaaS providers provide various databases such as ClearDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis to communicate with the applications.
4. Other tools
PaaS providers provide various other tools that are required to develop, test, and deploy the applications.
Advantages of PaaS
There are the following advantages of PaaS -
1) Simplified Development
PaaS allows developers to focus on development and innovation without worrying about infrastructure management.
2) Lower risk
No need for up-front investment in hardware and software. Developers only need a PC and an internet connection to start building applications.
3) Prebuilt business functionality
Some PaaS vendors also provide already defined business functionality so that users can avoid building everything from very scratch and hence can directly start the projects only.
4) Instant community
PaaS vendors frequently provide online communities where the developer can get the ideas to share experiences and seek advice from others.
5) Scalability
Applications deployed can scale from one to thousands of users without any changes to the applications.
Disadvantages of PaaS cloud computing layer
1) Vendor lock-in
One has to write the applications according to the platform provided by the PaaS vendor, so the migration of an application to another PaaS vendor would be a problem.
2) Data Privacy
Corporate data, whether it can be critical or not, will be private, so if it is not located within the walls of the company, there can be a risk in terms of privacy of data.
3) Integration with the rest of the systems applications
It may happen that some applications are local, and some are in the cloud. So there will be chances of increased complexity when we want to use data which in the cloud with the local data.

Software as a Service | SaaS
SaaS is also known as "On-Demand Software". It is a software distribution model in which services are hosted by a cloud service provider. These services are available to end-users over the internet so, the end-users do not need to install any software on their devices to access these services.
There are the following services provided by SaaS providers -
Business Services - SaaS Provider provides various business services to start-up the business. The SaaS business services include ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Customer Relationship Management), billing, and sales.
Document Management - SaaS document management is a software application offered by a third party (SaaS providers) to create, manage, and track electronic documents.
Example: Slack, Samepage, Box, and Zoho Forms.
Social Networks - As we all know, social networking sites are used by the general public, so social networking service providers use SaaS for their convenience and handle the general public's information.
Mail Services - To handle the unpredictable number of users and load on e-mail services, many e-mail providers offering their services using SaaS.






Advantages of SaaS cloud computing layer
1) SaaS is easy to buy
SaaS pricing is based on a monthly fee or annual fee subscription, so it allows organizations to access business functionality at a low cost, which is less than licensed applications.
Unlike traditional software, which is sold as a licensed based with an up-front cost (and often an optional ongoing support fee), SaaS providers are generally pricing the applications using a subscription fee, most commonly a monthly or annually fee.
2. One to Many
SaaS services are offered as a one-to-many model means a single instance of the application is shared by multiple users.
3. Less hardware required for SaaS
The software is hosted remotely, so organizations do not need to invest in additional hardware.
4. Low maintenance required for SaaS
Software as a service removes the need for installation, set-up, and daily maintenance for the organizations. The initial set-up cost for SaaS is typically less than the enterprise software. SaaS vendors are pricing their applications based on some usage parameters, such as a number of users using the application. So SaaS does easy to monitor and automatic updates.
5. No special software or hardware versions required
All users will have the same version of the software and typically access it through the web browser. SaaS reduces IT support costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the IaaS provider.
6. Multidevice support
SaaS services can be accessed from any device such as desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, and thin clients.
7. API Integration
SaaS services easily integrate with other software or services through standard APIs.
8. No client-side installation
SaaS services are accessed directly from the service provider using the internet connection, so do not need to require any software installation.
Disadvantages of SaaS cloud computing layer
1) Security
Actually, data is stored in the cloud, so security may be an issue for some users. However, cloud computing is not more secure than in-house deployment.
2) Latency issue
Since data and applications are stored in the cloud at a variable distance from the end-user, there is a possibility that there may be greater latency when interacting with the application compared to local deployment. Therefore, the SaaS model is not suitable for applications whose demand response time is in milliseconds.
3) Total Dependency on Internet
Without an internet connection, most SaaS applications are not usable.
4) Switching between SaaS vendors is difficult
Switching SaaS vendors involves the difficult and slow task of transferring the very large data files over the internet and then converting and importing them into another SaaS also.
