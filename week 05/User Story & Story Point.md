# User Stories 
User stories and story points are terms commonly used in Agile project management, specifically in Scrum methodology.

User stories are brief descriptions of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the user, written in a specific format: "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [reason]." The goal of a user story is to capture the user's requirements in a simple and understandable way, which helps the development team to understand what the user needs and how to deliver it.

# Story Points

Story points, on the other hand, are a relative measure of the effort required to complete a user story. The team estimates the story points by considering factors such as complexity, risk, and effort required. Story points are used to measure the team's capacity to complete a certain amount of work in a given time frame, such as a sprint.

The INVEST acronym is a set of characteristics that help ensure that user stories are well-written and well-understood. These characteristics are:

**Independent:** User stories should be self-contained and not dependent on other stories.

**Negotiable:** User stories should be flexible and open to discussion and refinement.

**Valuable:** User stories should deliver value to the user or customer.

**Estimable:** User stories should be able to be estimated in terms of effort or story points.

**Small:** User stories should be small enough to be completed in a single sprint.

**Testable:** User stories should be testable to ensure that they meet the acceptance criteria.

An epic is a large user story that can be broken down into smaller, more manageable stories. Epics are used when a feature or functionality is too large or complex to be captured in a single user story. The process for creating and managing epics typically involves:

**Identifying the epic:** The product owner identifies the feature or functionality that requires an epic.

**Defining the epic:** The epic is defined and broken down into smaller, more manageable user stories.

**Prioritizing the user stories:** The user stories are prioritized based on the product owner's requirements and the team's capacity.

**Managing the user stories:** The user stories are managed like any other user stories, and the team works on them during sprints until the epic is completed.

Overall, user stories, story points, INVEST characteristics, and epics are all important concepts in Agile project management, helping teams to break down complex features and deliver value to the user in a more manageable way.
