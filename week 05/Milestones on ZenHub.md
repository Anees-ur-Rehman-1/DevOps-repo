 # Sprint planning and Sprint Milestones
Sprint planning is the process of determining what work the development team will complete during the upcoming sprint. Sprint milestones are the key events and deadlines that need to be met during the sprint.

### Here are the steps to conduct sprint planning:

## Review the Product Backlog: 
The first step is for the product owner and development team to review the product backlog and identify the user stories that should be included in the upcoming sprint.

## Define Sprint Goals: 
The product owner and development team should define the sprint goals based on the user stories that will be included in the sprint. Sprint goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

## Break Down User Stories: 
The development team should break down the user stories into smaller tasks that can be completed during the sprint. This helps the team estimate the effort required for each task and ensures that the user stories are achievable within the sprint timeframe.

## Estimate Effort:
 The development team should estimate the effort required for each task using story points or another relative scale. This helps the team plan their work and ensures that they can complete the work within the sprint timeframe.

## Create Sprint Backlog:
 Based on the estimated effort and sprint goals, the development team should create a sprint backlog that lists the tasks that need to be completed during the sprint.

## Plan Sprint Milestones: 
The product owner and development team should plan the sprint milestones, which include key events and deadlines that need to be met during the sprint. Sprint milestones help the team stay on track and ensure that they are making progress towards their goals.

To create user stories and add them to milestones on ZenHub, follow these steps:

## Open ZenHub: 
Log in to your ZenHub account and open the repository where you want to add user stories and milestones.

## Create User Stories: 
Click on the "Issues" tab and then click "New Issue." Write a brief description of the user story in the title field and then add more details in the description field. Be sure to include who the user is, what they want to achieve, and why it is important.

## Add Labels and Milestones:
 ZenHub allows you to add labels and milestones to each user story. Labels can be used to categorize user stories by theme, priority, or other criteria. Milestones are used to track progress towards a specific goal or deadline. To add a milestone, click on the "Milestones" tab and then click "New Milestone." Enter the milestone details, including the title and due date.

## Assign User Stories to Milestones:
 To assign a user story to a milestone, open the user story and click on the "Milestone" dropdown. Select the appropriate milestone from the list.

## Review and Prioritize: 
Review the user stories and milestones to ensure that they align with the product vision and goals. Prioritize the user stories based on their importance and value to the user.

## Monitor Progress: 
Throughout the sprint, monitor progress towards the milestones and adjust the sprint plan as needed. Use ZenHub's reporting and tracking tools to stay on track and ensure that the team is making progress towards their goals.
