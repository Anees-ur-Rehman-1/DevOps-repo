# What are microservices?
Microservices describe an architecture in which applications are modularized and split into a set of lightweight, independent services that are each built to provide one functionality and to be developed, deployed, and updated independently without affecting other services in the application. RESTful microservices communicate with each other by using the remote access protocol Representational State Transfer (REST).
Microservices are independent. Each microservice has its own codebase and is owned by a relatively small development team. It has clear API boundaries that give the team that is developing the service flexibility to evolve the implementation.
Microservices must be resilient. Application stability depends on individual microservices being robust enough to handle failures. This stability is a big difference from traditional architectures, where the supporting infrastructure handles failures for you. Each service needs to apply isolation patterns, such as circuit breakers and bulkheads, to contain failures and define appropriate fallback behaviors to protect upstream services.
Microservices are stateless, transient processes. The state should be stored in external backing cloud services, like Redis, rather than in-memory. Fast startup and graceful shutdown behavior further allow microservices to work well in automated environments that create and destroy instances in response to load or to maintain system health.

# What are Cloud Native Microservices?
Cloud Native Microservices are a software architecture approach that emphasizes the use of microservices in a cloud-native environment. It is a modern approach to application development that takes advantage of the scalability and flexibility of cloud computing to build applications that are agile, resilient, and efficient.

Microservices are a way of breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, independent services. Each service performs a specific function and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. This approach allows developers to update, scale, and deploy individual services without affecting the rest of the application, making it easier to manage and maintain.

Cloud-native, on the other hand, refers to applications that are specifically designed to run in cloud environments. These applications are designed to take advantage of cloud services like auto-scaling, load balancing, and high availability. Cloud-native applications are also designed to be containerized, meaning that each service is packaged into a separate container that can be deployed and managed independently.

The combination of cloud-native and microservices creates a powerful architecture that allows applications to be developed, deployed, and scaled quickly and efficiently. By breaking down applications into smaller, independent services, developers can build and update applications more quickly and with less risk. Additionally, by running these services in containers, they can be easily moved between different environments, making it easier to scale and maintain them.

Cloud Native Microservices also embrace other key principles of modern application development, such as DevOps and continuous delivery. DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to shorten the development lifecycle and improve application quality. Continuous delivery is the practice of constantly updating and releasing new versions of an application to production, reducing the time it takes to get new features in front of users.

In summary, Cloud Native Microservices is an approach to application development that combines the benefits of microservices and cloud-native architecture. By breaking down applications into smaller, independent services and running them in containers, developers can build and maintain applications that are agile, scalable, and resilient. This approach allows for faster development, easier maintenance, and more efficient scaling, making it a popular choice for modern application development.
