#What Is DevOps? 
________________________________________
#Definition 
DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between development teams and IT operations teams to automate and streamline the software delivery process. The goal of DevOps is to improve the speed and efficiency of software development and deployment while maintaining high quality and reliability

#How does DevOps work? 
________________________________________

A DevOps team includes developers and IT operations working collaboratively throughout the product lifecycle, in order to increase the speed and quality of software deployment. It’s a new way of working, a cultural shift , that has significant implications for teams and the organizations they work for.
Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams merge into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle — from development and test to deployment and operations — and have a range of multidisciplinary skills.
DevOps teams use tools to automate and accelerate processes, which helps to increase reliability. A DevOps toolchain helps teams tackle important DevOps fundamentals including continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and collaboration.
DevOps values are sometimes applied to teams other than development. When security teams adopt a DevOps approach, security is an active and integrated part of the development process. This is called DevSecOps.

#The DevOps lifecycle 
________________________________________
Because of the continuous nature of DevOps, practitioners use the infinity loop to show how the phases of the DevOps lifecycle relate to each other. Despite appearing to flow sequentially, the loop symbolizes the need for constant collaboration and iterative improvement throughout the entire lifecycle.

 
The DevOps lifecycle consists of eight phases representing the processes, capabilities, and tools needed for development (on the left side of the loop) and operations (on the right side of the loop). Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality.
1. Plan: Defining the objectives, requirements, and scope of the software project.Tools used: Trello, Asana, Jira
2. Code: Writing and reviewing code for the software. It includes version control, code review, and collaboration among developers. Tools used: Bitbucket, GitLab, Git, GitHub
3. Build: Compiling the code and generating executable files Tools used: Gradle, Maven
4. Test: Testing for bugs and errors. Tools used: Selenium, JUni
5. Release: Preparing the software for release and production. Tools used: Jenkins
6. Deploy: Deploying the software to production environments. Tools used: Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Chef, Puppet
7. Operate: Smooth production assurance. Tools used: Nagios, New Relic
8. Monitor: Monitoring for issues, bugs, and errors, and taking corrective action as needed. Tools used: Nagios
Stages of DevOps
1. Version Control: Collaborative coding, change/ update code. (GitHub)
2. Continuous Integration (CI): Integrating and testing code changes frequently to ensure that code is working as expected and there are no conflicts. (Jenkins)
3. Continuous Delivery (CD): Deploying code changes to a testing environment, and automating the delivery process to ensure that new features and updates are released quickly and reliably. (Maven integrated with Jenkins)
4. Continuous Deployment (CD): Deploying code changes directly to production without any manual intervention, ensuring that code is delivered quickly and consistently. (Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Kubernetes, Docker)
5. Continuous Monitoring: Monitoring the software in production and identifying issues or bugs as they arise, so that they can be quickly resolved.
