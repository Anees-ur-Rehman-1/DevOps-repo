User stories and story points are commonly used in Agile software development as a way to describe features or requirements in a concise and measurable way.

## User stories
User stories are brief, informal descriptions of a feature or requirement from the perspective of a user or customer. They are typically written in the format of "As a [user], I want [feature], so that [reason]." For example, "As a customer, I want to be able to easily search for products on the website, so that I can quickly find what I'm looking for."

## Story points
Story points, on the other hand, are a measure of the effort required to complete a user story. They are usually assigned using a relative scale, such as the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.), and take into account factors such as complexity, uncertainty, and effort.

## INVEST characteristics of a story
The INVEST characteristics of a story are a set of guidelines used to ensure that user stories are well-formed and effective:

**Independent:** The story should be self-contained and not dependent on other stories.

**Negotiable:** The details of the story should be open to discussion and negotiation between the team and the customer.

**Valuable:** The story should provide value to the customer or user.

**Estimable:** The story should be able to be estimated and broken down into smaller tasks.

**Small:** The story should be small enough to be completed within a single iteration.

**Testable:** The story should be testable and have clear acceptance criteria.

## What is Epic
An epic is a large, high-level user story that represents a significant piece of work that may take multiple iterations or sprints to complete. Epics are often used to describe features or requirements that are too large or complex to be broken down into smaller user stories. They are typically broken down into smaller, more manageable stories called "slices" or "features" that can be completed within a single iteration.

### Here are the steps to create an epic:

1. Identify the business objective or goal that the epic will help achieve. This could be a new feature or product, or a significant improvement to an existing one.

2. Define the scope of the epic, including the users or customers who will benefit from it, the functionality it will provide, and any constraints or requirements.

3. Break the epic down into smaller features or slices that can be completed within a single iteration. Each slice should be a self-contained user story with clear acceptance criteria.

4. Prioritize the features or slices based on their importance to the overall business objective, and estimate their effort using story points or another relative scale.

5. Create a roadmap or release plan that outlines how the features or slices will be completed over multiple iterations or sprints, and communicate this plan to stakeholders.

6. Continuously monitor and refine the epic as it progresses, adjusting the scope, priorities, and estimates as necessary based on feedback and changing requirements.
