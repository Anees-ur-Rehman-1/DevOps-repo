# Virtualization in Cloud and how virtualization in cloud works?
Virtualization is a technology that enables multiple virtual environments to run on a single physical machine, and it is a crucial component of cloud computing. In the cloud, virtualization is used to create virtual machines (VMs) that are hosted on physical servers in a data center.

Virtualization in cloud computing works by using a hypervisor, which is a layer of software that enables multiple virtual machines to share the same physical resources. The hypervisor creates a virtualized environment on the physical server, allowing each virtual machine to access a portion of the underlying physical server's resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage.

Each virtual machine is allocated a portion of the physical server's resources, and it can be configured with its own operating system, applications, and data. Multiple virtual machines can run on a single physical server, and each virtual machine is completely isolated from other virtual machines running on the same physical server.

Cloud providers use virtualization to offer a variety of services, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). In IaaS, customers can rent virtual machines from the cloud provider and use them to run their own applications and services. In PaaS, the cloud provider offers a platform for customers to develop, run, and manage their applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

The benefits of virtualization in cloud computing include:

Improved resource utilization:
 Virtualization enables more efficient use of computing resources by allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server.

## Increased flexibility:
 Virtualization enables customers to easily scale their computing resources up or down based on their needs.

## Reduced costs:
 Virtualization enables customers to reduce their hardware and software costs by running multiple virtual machines on a single physical server.

Improved availability and reliability: Virtualization enables cloud providers to offer redundancy and disaster recovery features, ensuring that customers' virtual machines are always available and accessible.

In summary, virtualization is a key technology that enables cloud providers to offer scalable, flexible, and cost-effective services to their customers. By using virtualization, businesses can take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing and focus on their core business objectives.
