# Core principles of Kanban
Kanban is a Lean management method that originated in Japanese manufacturing and is now used in many industries for project and workflow management. The core principles of Kanban are based on continuous improvement, customer focus, and efficiency. Here is a step-by-step guide to the core principles of Kanban:

## Visualize Workflow:
 The first principle of Kanban is to visualize the workflow. This involves creating a visual representation of the steps involved in a process or project, and making it visible to everyone involved. The most common way to visualize workflow in Kanban is to use a Kanban board, which is a board with columns representing different stages in the process, and cards representing work items.

## Limit Work in Progress:
 The second principle of Kanban is to limit work in progress. This means that the number of work items that can be in progress at any given time is limited, in order to prevent bottlenecks and improve efficiency. The number of work items that can be in progress is determined by the capacity of the team and the resources available.

## Manage Flow: 
The third principle of Kanban is to manage flow. This involves ensuring that work items move smoothly and quickly through the workflow, with minimal delays or interruptions. This is done by identifying and removing bottlenecks, and by continuously improving the process to reduce waste and increase efficiency.

## Make Process Policies Explicit: 
The fourth principle of Kanban is to make process policies explicit. This means that the rules and guidelines for the process or project are clearly defined and communicated to everyone involved. This helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.

## Implement Feedback Loops: 
The fifth principle of Kanban is to implement feedback loops. This involves gathering feedback from customers, stakeholders, and team members, and using it to improve the process or project. Feedback loops can take many forms, such as regular meetings, surveys, or reviews.

## Improve Collaboratively and Evolve Experimentally:
 The sixth principle of Kanban is to improve collaboratively and evolve experimentally. This means that the team is encouraged to work together to identify and implement improvements, and to experiment with new ideas and approaches. This helps to foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.

By following these core principles of Kanban, teams are able to improve their efficiency, reduce waste, and deliver higher-quality results to their customers.
