# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Definition
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time. The goal of the SDLC is to produce superior software that meets and exceeds all customer expectations and demands. The SDLC defines and outlines a detailed plan with stages, or phases, that each encompass their own process and deliverables. Adherence to the SDLC enhances development speed and minimizes project risks and costs associated with alternative methods of production
## Definition
Software Development life cycle (SDLC) is a spiritual model used in project management that defines the stages include in an information system development project, from an initial feasibility study to the maintenance of the completed application.

## Importance of SDLC 
•	It provides a standardized framework that defines activities and deliverables
•	It aids in project planning, estimating, and scheduling
•	It makes project tracking and control easier
•	It increases visibility on all aspects of the life cycle to all stakeholders involved in the development process
•	It increases the speed of development
•	It improves client relations
•	It decreases project risks
•	It decreases project management expenses and the overall cost of production
# Working of SDLC 
##Planning phase
The planning phase encompasses all aspects of project and product management. This typically includes resource allocation, capacity planning, project scheduling, cost estimation, and provisioning.
During the planning phase, the development team collects input from stakeholders involved in the project; customers, sales, internal and external experts, and developers. This input is synthesized into a detailed definition of the requirements for creating the desired software. The team also determines what resources are required to satisfy the project requirements, and then infers the associated cost.
Expectations are clearly defined during this stage as well, the team determines not only what is desired in the software, but also what is NOT. The tangible deliverables produced from this phase include project plans, estimated costs, projected schedules, and procurement needs. 
## Coding phase
The coding phase includes system design in an integrated development environment. It also includes static code analysis and code review for multiple types of devices.
Building Phase
The building phase takes the code requirements determined earlier and uses those to begin actually building the software.
Testing Phase
The phase entails the evaluation of the created software. The testing team evaluates the developed products in order to assess whether they meet the requirements specified in the ‘planning’ phase. 
Assessments entail the performance of functional testing
unit testing, code quality testing, integration testing, system testing, security testing, performance testing and acceptance testing, as well as nonfunctional testing. If a defect is identified, developers are notified. Validated (actual) defects are resolved, and a new version of the software is produced.
The best method for ensuring that all tests are run regularly and reliably , is to implement automated testing. Continuous integration tools assist with this need.
## Release Phase
The release phase involves the team packaging, managing and deploying releases across different environments.
## Deploy Phase
In the deployment phase, the software is officially released into the production environment. 
## Operate Phase
The operate phase entails the use of the software in the production environment.
## Monitor Phase
In the monitor phase, various elements of the software are monitored. These could include the overall system performance, user experience, new security vulnerabilities, an analysis of bugs or errors in the system.
