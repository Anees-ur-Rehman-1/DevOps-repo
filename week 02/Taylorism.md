# Taylorism
Taylorism, also known as scientific management, is a management philosophy that was developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th century. Taylorism aimed to improve productivity and efficiency in manufacturing by breaking down work processes into smaller, simpler tasks that could be easily performed by unskilled workers. The goal of Taylorism was to maximize efficiency and productivity by standardizing and controlling the work process.

The core principles of Taylorism include:

### Scientific study of work:
Taylor believed that work could be studied scientifically to identify the most efficient way to perform a task. This involved analyzing each step of the work process to identify unnecessary movements and eliminate them.

### Standardization of work: 
Once the most efficient way of performing a task had been identified, Taylor advocated for standardizing the work process to ensure consistency and eliminate variation. This involved developing detailed procedures for each task and training workers to perform them in a uniform way.

### Division of labor: 
Taylor believed that work should be divided into smaller, specialized tasks to make it easier to manage and improve efficiency. By breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones, workers could be trained to perform their tasks more quickly and efficiently.

### Control of work: 
Taylorism involved a high degree of control over the work process. This included strict supervision, time and motion studies, and piece-rate pay, where workers were paid based on the amount of work they produced. This approach was designed to motivate workers to perform their tasks more quickly and efficiently.

While Taylorism was successful in increasing productivity and efficiency in many industries, it also had some negative consequences. The focus on efficiency and control led to de-skilling of workers, with repetitive and monotonous work causing boredom and low job satisfaction. This, in turn, led to high rates of employee turnover and absenteeism.

Today, Taylorism is viewed as an outdated management philosophy, and many of its principles have been replaced by more modern approaches to management, such as lean manufacturing and agile management. However, some aspects of Taylorism, such as the scientific study of work and the use of data to optimize processes, are still relevant in modern manufacturing and other industries.
