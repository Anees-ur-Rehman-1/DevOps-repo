Continuous deployment (CD) is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment.

The software release cycle has evolved over time.

Now, tools can automate this entire deployment process, which allows engineering organizations to focus on core business needs instead of infrastructure overhead
