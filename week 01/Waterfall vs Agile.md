# Difference between Waterfall and Agile model
## Agile vs. Waterfall: At a Glance
### Agile Methodology
** Approach:**
Frequent stakeholder interaction
### Flexibility:
High
### Requires:
Team initiative and short-term deadlines

Agile methodology was developed as a response to Waterfall’s more rigid structure. As a result, it’s a much more fluid form of project management. A software development project can take years to complete, and technology can change significantly during that time. Agile was developed as a flexible method that welcomes incorporating changes of direction even late in the process, as well as accounting for stakeholders’ feedback throughout the process.

In Agile, the team will work on phases of the project concurrently, often with short-term deadlines. Additionally, the team, rather than a project manager, drives the project’s direction. This can empower the team to be motivated and more productive, but also requires a more self-directed team.
